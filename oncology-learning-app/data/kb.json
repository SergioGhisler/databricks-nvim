      "answer": "B-cell",
      "explanation": "B-cell lymphoma often has better response duration and overall prognosis than T-cell in many cohorts.",
      "rationale": "Immunophenotype helps predict remission duration and should guide owner counseling early.",
      "commonMistake": "Assuming all multicentric lymphoma behaves similarly regardless of B/T-cell status."

      "modelAnswer": "Hospitalize if unstable, start broad-spectrum antibiotics, delay/reduce next dose, and repeat CBC monitoring.",
      "explanation": "Severe neutropenia requires infection risk mitigation and protocol modification for safety.",
      "rationale": "Management balances immediate sepsis prevention with long-term protocol continuity and safety.",
      "commonMistake": "Continuing full-dose treatment without interval bloodwork and toxicity grading review."

      "options": ["Surgery alone is usually curative", "Adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy is commonly recommended", "Radiation is first-line systemic therapy", "No staging is needed before treatment"],
      "answer": "Adjuvant doxorubicin-based therapy is commonly recommended",
      "explanation": "Even after surgery, metastatic risk remains high, so adjuvant systemic therapy is frequently discussed.",
      "rationale": "High biologic aggressiveness means local control alone rarely addresses systemic disease risk.",
      "commonMistake": "Overstating benefit of surgery alone and under-communicating metastatic relapse risk."

      "answer": "Stage thoroughly and discuss multimodal therapy",
      "explanation": "Advanced mast cell disease often requires integrated surgery/systemic/radiation planning.",
